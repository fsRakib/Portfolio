            <h3>I'm Md. Rakibul Kabir, a <span>Software Engineer</span></h3>
            <p>
              Hi! I'm Rakib, a passionate software engineering student pursuing
              my degree with a strong focus on full-stack development and AI
              integration. Committed to academic excellence, I thrive in
              challenging environments that encourage critical thinking,
              creativity, and innovative problem-solving. With a keen interest
              in programming and developing cutting-edge applications, I
              actively seek opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills both
              inside and outside the classroom. I believe in continuous learning
              and staying updated with the latest technologies to build
              impactful solutions.
